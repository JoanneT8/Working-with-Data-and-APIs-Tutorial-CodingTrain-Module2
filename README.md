# Working-with-Data-and-APIs-Tutorial-CodingTrain-Module2
This project is the result of me following CodingTrain's tutorial called "Working with Data and APIs in JS" that consist of 3 modules. This is the repo for the 2nd module that goes into depth of how to:

  [] Set up NeDB <br>
  [] POST and GET requests <br>
  [] Utilize a mapping API (Leaflet and Open Maps)<br>
  [] use the Geolocation API <br>
  [] store information into database (locally on my computer) <br>
  [] Use Express, NPM, nodemon <br>
  
  This project is a Web app. I plan to further develop it by adding more styles and functionality to the Web App. 
  The webpage is currently formatted using Bootstrap.
  
  Here is a link to the tutorial series on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YxDKpFzf_2D84p0cyk4T7X 
  This is my introduction to using APIs and JS in a more applied setting.

  I have taken CodeAcademy's Javascript course and currently have that as a foundation.
  I have previously worked with HTML/CSS and a bit of Bootstrap before.
